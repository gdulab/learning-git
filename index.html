        <h1>Pink Floyd - Wish you were here</h1>
        <p>
            So, so you think you can tell<br>
            Heaven from hell?<br>
            Blue skies from pain?<br>
            Can you tell a green field<br>
            From a cold steel rail?<br>
            A smile from a veil?<br>
            Do you think you can tell?<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Did they get you to trade<br>
            Your heroes for ghosts?<br>
            Hot ashes for trees?<br>
            Hot air for a cool breeze?<br>
            Cold comfort for change?<br>
            Did you exchange<br>
            A walk-on part in the war<br>
            For a leading role in a cage?<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            How I wish, how I wish you were here<br>
            We're just two lost souls<br>
            Swimming in a fish bowl<br>
            Year after year<br>
            Running over the same old ground<br>
            What have we found?<br>
            The same old fears<br>
            Wish you were here<br>
        </p>
